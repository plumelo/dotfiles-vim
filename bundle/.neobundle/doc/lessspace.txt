*lessspace.txt*           LessSpace: Better whitespace stripping for Vim

                                                       *lessspace-intro*
This simple plugin will strip the trailing whitespace from the file
you are editing.  However, it does this only on the lines you have
visited in Insert mode; it leaves all the others untouched.

USAGE                                                  *lessspace-usage*

    For basic usage, just install it and forget it.  LessSpace works
    automatically.

    LessSpace provides a couple commands that allow you to turn it on
    or off, either globally or per-buffer.  The global commands are:

        - `LessSpace`     Turn on whitespace stripping       *:LessSpace*
        - `LessSpace!`    Turn off whitespace stripping      *:LessSpace!*

    The per-buffer commands are very similar:

        - `LessSpaceBuf`  Turn on whitespace stripping    *:LessSpaceBuf*
        - `LessSpaceBuf!` Turn off whitespace stripping   *:LessSpaceBuf!*


======================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                  *lessspace-configuration*

    LessSpace doesn't offer many configuration options, because
    everything happens automatically when you enter and leave Insert
    mode.

                                                   *g:lessspace_enabled*
    You can disable LessSpace on startup by setting the
    |g:lessspace_enabled| variable:
>
        let g:lessspace_enabled = 0
<
    (The same effect can be achieved after startup by just running
    |:LessSpace!|.)

                                                    *g:lessspace_normal*
    By default, LessSpace strips whitespace after normal mode
    operations (such as when you |put| something from a register).  If
    you don't want this, you can have LessSpace only work in insert
    mode by setting |g:lessspace_normal|:
>
        let g:lessspace_normal = 0
<
                                                 *g:lessspace_whitelist*
                                                 *g:lessspace_blacklist*
    You can also specify the filetypes that it operates on by
    specifying a filetype whitelist or blacklist.  By default, nothing
    is blacklisted.  You can change this by setting either of the
    `g:lessspace_whitelist` or `g:lessspace_blacklist` variables,
    probably in your |vimrc| file.  These variables should be lists of
    the desired filetypes.  For example, to only operate on Vim and
    Ruby files, you could use:
>
        let g:lessspace_whitelist = ['ruby', 'vim']
<
    And to operate on everything but Python files:
>
        let g:lessspace_blacklist = ['python']
<
    (Previously, the whitelist had to be specified as a regex string.
    If you are using this form, you should update to the list-based
    method, as this will be removed soon.)
